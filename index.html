      <div id="about" class="section">
        <h2>About First Baptist Church</h2>
        <p>First Baptist Church is located in Frostproof, FL. Our
          beliefs are based on the Bible and centered on Jesus Christ.
          Our mission is very simple: to lead people to honor and
          glorify Jesus Christ. That means we’re not about a building or
          some complicated religious system, but about helping people
          from all backgrounds discover the joy that comes from knowing
          and serving Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p>We invite you to come and worship with us this Sunday at
          11:00 AM. We know that going to a new church can be
          intimidating, so we try to do things in a way where you’ll
          feel welcome. You’ll discover a warm atmosphere, practical
          teaching from God's Word, and lots of friendly people pursuing
          God together. And with childcare and classes for all ages,
          your family will love it too!</p>

          where you’ll feel welcome and not like an outsider. When you
          come, you can participate or just sit back and observe.</p>
