            <h2>About First Baptist Church</h2>
            <p>First Baptist Church is located in Frostproof, FL. Our beliefs are based on the Bible and centered on Jesus Christ. Our mission is very simple: to lead people to honor and glorify Jesus Christ. That means we’re not about a building or some complicated religious system, but about helping people from all backgrounds discover the joy that comes from knowing and serving Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>We invite you to come and worship with us this Sunday at 11:00 AM. We know that going to a new church can be intimidating, so we try to do things in a way where you’ll feel welcome. You’ll discover a warm atmosphere, practical teaching from God's Word, and lots of friendly people pursuing God together. And with childcare and classes for all ages, your family will love it too!</p>
